	Description: This agent is used by the Navigator and Request web pages to perform intranet authentication.
	It originally utilized a CWA java library and a BluePages lotusscript library.   This was updated in early 2015
	to utilize an updated IIPCWA library for authentication and a BluePages java library.

	It was updated again in July of 2015 to utilize a new Java library that contains the most current Java libraries
	for BluePages access and authentication.  All the Java code was consolidated into one Java library.

	It references a new custom wrapper class that does the actual calls to the functional library classes.
	This was done because handling some of the return objects from the Java calls was difficult if not impossible
	in Lotusscript.  The wrapper class takes the same input but returns string for both functions.
