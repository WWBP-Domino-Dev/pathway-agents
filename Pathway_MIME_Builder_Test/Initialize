SUMMARY
Look for new documents in the database.  Move to the Inbox if contains the web template field "PWayWebReq" or "PWayWebSurvey"

If attachments are included they will be part of the document, not in a field.  Look for attachments and move them to
a new RT field so they are visible in the status doc.

HISTORY
9/24/2009
In order to migrate to a new server a temporary test will be in place to look for email templates that are sent after the transition.

9/2/2009
Copied from the PSN PATHway database.

11/2/2009
Added call to BluePages API to convert the internet address used in the web form to the Notes address.  This will be used as the
SendTo value by the PathwayProcessTemplate routine when constructing the reply document.

7/9/2012
Updated BluePages code block to do a fuzzy search for the name if the email address was not matched.
If the name returns no entries (unlikely) then use the requestor's name and entered email address.
